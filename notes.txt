> first we initiate the typescript into the main folder so we can make any changes 
  into the the folder

we can do that using 

tsc --init


> then specify the root folder where you want to keep the typescript files
  for that we need to modify the location of rootDir as "./src".

  similarly for the js files we have to specify the folder
  for that we need to modify the location of OutDir as "./build/js"


  > then thereafter we have to compile that all using tsc -w then all will work     
    automatically
